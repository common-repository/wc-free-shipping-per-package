The most Advanced Free Shipping Per Package for WooCommerce plugin that allows you to define flexible Free Shipping scenarios for individual Cart shipping packages based on totals, weight, quantity, volume and many more.

== Description ==

As a business owner, offering **Free Shipping** to your customers is an effective way to attract more sales and retain customer loyalty. However, it can be a challenge to set up **Free Shipping** options that meet the specific needs of your business. That's why we created the **Free Shipping Per Package** plugin for WooCommerce.

With our plugin, you can configure advanced conditions for every shipping zone when a Free Shipping option should be offered. The plugin is designed to work seamlessly with the [Shipping Packages for WooCommerce](https://1teamsoftware.com/product/woocommerce-shipping-packages) plugin, which allows you to split cart based on a flexible group by condition.

Using our plugin, you can offer Free Shipping based on cart package weight, cart package subtotal, or sell from different warehouses/dropshipping providers. You can set minimum and maximum quantity, subtotal, weight, and volume requirements for Free Shipping, and require a valid Free Shipping coupon. You can also choose Free Shipping as a default shipping method and specify a custom name for the Shipping Method that will be displayed to the customer.

== Features ==
* Conditions calculated based on Shipping Package contents, instead of the cart.
* Unlimited Free Shipping rules for each Shipping Zone.
* The ability to specify a custom name for the Shipping Method that will be displayed to the customer.
* The option to choose Free Shipping as a default shipping method.
* The ability to require all or any condition to match for the Cart package to qualify for Free Shipping.
* The option to require a valid Free Shipping coupon.
* The ability to set minimum and maximum quantity, subtotal, weight, and volume requirements for Free Shipping.

If you're looking for even more advanced features, our PRO version is available for purchase. Our PRO version includes all the features of the free version, plus several additional features, such as the ability to display a Cart Notice when the shipping package does not meet Free Shipping requirements, the ability to hide all other Shipping Methods, and the ability to require all or any of the products to belong to selected Vendors.

Our PRO version also includes support for WCFM, Dokan, WCMP, WCPV, and YITH multivendor marketplaces. You can require a Customer to belong to one of the specified User Roles, require all or any of the products to belong to one of the specified Categories or Shipping Classes, and require all or any of the products to have one of the specified Tags or Taxonomy values. You can even schedule Free Shipping for specific days of the week, specific dates, and specific time intervals.
